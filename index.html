          <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;">What Is A Libertarian?</h2>
          <p1>The Libertarian Party is the largest third-party in the United States and acts completely separate from
            the two major parties. As Libertarians, our philosophy holds two core principles: only you know how to best
            live your life, and don't hurt people or take their stuff. The end result of these two principles is a
            legitimate small government tasked only with keeping the peace and protecting property rights, nothing else.
            In a Libertarian world, there aren't three-letter regulatory agencies that make up rules to take your guns
            or a bloated deficit being used to line the pockets of politicians. Instead, there is just yourself and your
            community.</p1>
          <p1>In Bartow, Polk, and Floyd County, we're the affiliate to the larger Libertarian Party of Georgia and lead
            the fight locally on instances of government abuse and overpolicing by spreading the word and monitoring the
            other two parties from getting too comfortable. We also work with other freedom organizations in the state
            to introduce their work into the tri-county area.</p1>
          </div>

          <div class="mobile-only">
            <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;">What Is A Libertarian?</h2>
          <p1>The Libertarian Party, the largest U.S. third party, stands apart from Democrats and Republicans. Its core principles are simple: live your life as you choose and don’t harm others or take their property. Libertarians advocate for a small government focused solely on peace and property rights—no overreaching agencies, no gun grabs, and no bloated deficits. It’s about you and your community.</p1>
          <p1>Here in Bartow, Polk, and Floyd County, we're on a mission to elect libertarians to local offices to lower our actually property taxes and stretch every dollar they can.

        <h2 style="color: #0D3B66;">Donate Today</h2>
        <p1 style="color: #0D3B66;">Being a third-party is expensive since we don't have the major donors like the other
          two parties. Fortunately, that means we can make our own decisions without dark money influencing what we do.
          On the flip side, that requires grassroot donations to help fund our operations here in Northwest Georgia. If
          you support our work, please consider donating to the Libertarian Party of Georgia below.</p1>

          to plan strategy and discuss new developments within our local tri-county area. You don't have to be a
          registered libertarian to join in the conversation, we accept all freedom-loving people from any political
          party to come have some fun while we discuss shared interests.</p1>

          <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA; padding-top: 0%;">Business Regulations</h2>
          <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">The world runs on commerce, money, and free trade of goods and labor. At a basic
            level, labor income is the lifeline of a family's household. When the Government restricts the ability of a
            person to transact business or work in certain industries, it makes more difficult the life of the
            household.
            Except when absolutely needed, the Government should have no ability to restrict businesses with added
            regulations.<br><br>Libertarians detest excessive business regulation as an unconstitutional exercise of
            government authority into the lives of working Americans. Most of these regulations take place on the local
            level, with measures like zoning laws and finance ordinances for businesses to transact commerce. In our
            area
            especially, local councils have weaponized city licenses to impose their own values on small businesses. If
            a
            business doesn't conform to the local council, they can have their license pulled. This is a gross abuse of
            power and Libertarians are full against it.</p1>

          <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA; padding-top: 0%;">Localized Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
          <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Last year, the Rome City Commission spent thousands of dollars on attorneys fees
            to investigate an ethics complaint against one of their own Commissioners. Weeks later, the attorney
            resigned
            the
            case, citing the irresponsible and personally repulsive behavior of the council. Following this resignation,
            another attorney was retained who had to begin their work from square one. This feat led to a complete and
            utter waste of taxpayer dollars because Rome's City Commissioners couldn't maintain professionalism for a
            serious matter.<br><br>Every dollar brought into the government's control was done by theft: all taxation is
            theft. If they're going to waste the money, they don't deserve it. At the very least, every dollar should
            produce a dollar's worth of value. Libertarians will stretch every dollar possible so as to avoid increasing
            taxes.</p1>

          <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Cartersville has an ordinance requiring convenience store owners to place cameras
            in
            their stores recording all customers and that the footage recorded be easily accessible to police at all
            times. According to Comparitech, Atlanta is the "most-watched city" in the United States with "124 cameras
            per
            1,000 people" at the police's control. With developing technology in Artificial Intelligence and tracking
            applications, the major surveillance state is here and watching your moves. Now, more than ever, it is
            important for citizens to tell their government that they do not want to be recorded and tracked for every
            public interaction.<br><br>The Libertarian Party of Georgia started Project Banish Big Brother to work
            locally
            to stop major surveillance projects from taking off.</p1>

        <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Income is vital to a household's survival. Government restrictions on work or business make life harder for families. Unless absolutely necessary, added regulations should not limit businesses. Libertarians oppose excessive regulation, viewing it as unconstitutional interference. Locally, measures like zoning laws and city licenses are often misused, with councils imposing personal values on small businesses by threatening their licenses. Libertarians strongly oppose such abuses of power.</p1>

        <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA; padding-top: 10;"><mark>Localized Fiscal Responsibility</mark></h2>
        <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Last year, the Rome City Commission wasted thousands on attorney fees for an ethics complaint against a Commissioner. The first attorney quit, citing the council's unprofessional behavior, forcing a new attorney to start from scratch. This wasted taxpayer money, which Libertarians see as theft. If taxes are collected, every dollar should provide value. Libertarians pledge to maximize efficiency and avoid tax increases.</p1>

      <div style="margin: auto; width: 70%;">
        <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA; padding-top: 10;"><mark>Banishing Big Brother</mark></h2>
        <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Cartersville requires convenience stores to install cameras accessible to police, contributing to a growing surveillance state. Atlanta already leads the U.S. in surveillance, with 124 cameras per 1,000 people. With advancing AI and tracking tech, privacy is at risk. Citizens must push back against constant monitoring. The Libertarian Party of Georgia’s Project Banish Big Brother aims to stop local surveillance initiatives.</p1>
